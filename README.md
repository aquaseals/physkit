- Covers all formulas from Kinematics in Ontario Grade 11 Physics
- Kinematics - including kinematic equations and adding vectors in 2D

## How to Use?
If the question asks for varying amount of inputs, type the number of values you are giving (e.x. you want to add 3 vectors together, so type 3. or you want add 45 )

Then, type in all the required values for the calculation, make sure to fill in ALL inputs before expecting an answer. There is no 'submit' button because it will detect when you have filled all the rrequired inputs, then calulcate and display the answer below.
